# SHARK ANALYSIS : Understanding Shark Attacks on Humans

## Overview

Welcome to my Shark Analysis project! In this repository, we explore the intriguing topic of shark attacks on human beings in aquatic environments. The main objective of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to shark attacks and to dispel some common misconceptions about these fascinating creatures.

## Introduction

Sharks have been the subject of fear and fascination for centuries, especially due to their occasional interactions with humans. However, it is crucial to recognize that shark attacks are rare events, and understanding the circumstances surrounding such incidents is essential for promoting coexistence and mitigating risks.

## Data Collection

The Shark Research Institute (SRI) maintains a log of shark attacks worldwide, the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF). It is continually updated as new incidents occur and was started in 1992 by the SRI. The purpose of the GSAF is to "use forensic analysis to demonstrate and emphasize the likelihood of shark/human interactions in comparison to the myriad dangers that we face in our daily lives. With a better understanding of these interactions we can minimize the possibility of being injured by a shark, and shift the discussion from fear to conservation of all shark species worldwide.

## Data Preprocessing

Before diving into the analysis, we performed thorough data preprocessing to clean and organize the data. This step involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and filtering irrelevant information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the EDA phase, we delved into the data to gain insights into the patterns and trends of shark attacks. We visualized the data, explored attack hotspots, and examined relationships between various variables. This analysis provides valuable context to understand the circumstances surrounding these events.

## Machine Learning Models

To further investigate the factors contributing to shark attacks, we developed machine learning models. These models were trained on historical data to predict potential risk factors associated with shark-human interactions.

## Results and Insights

The results of our analysis shed light on the factors that might lead to shark attacks and how they are often the result of misunderstandings and natural behavior. We also aim to dispel common myths about sharks and highlight their vital role in marine ecosystems.

## Conclusion

By conducting this analysis, we hope to foster a more informed perspective on shark attacks, Understanding these apex predators better can help us develop appropriate safety measures and minimize potential risks during aquatic activities.
